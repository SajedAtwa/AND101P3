# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Sajed Atwa**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Woofer** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **Woofer is a twitter app made for dogs, so that our furry friends can share photos and chat with eachother. It features a new login/sign up page that has the dog theme baked into it.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤ªðŸ¤£**
